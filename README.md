PROJECT PORTFOLIO: ATM Simulation
Project Name: Python WIT ATM

Repository: https://github.com/sabill/python-wit-atm

Developer: Sabila (GitHub: sabill)

Tech Stack: Python

1. Project Overview
The Python WIT ATM is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to simulate the core functionalities of a banking Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project demonstrates the practical application of Python programming logic, control flow, and state management to handle financial transactions securely and accurately.

2. Key Features
This application allows users to perform essential banking operations in a simulated environment:

User Authentication: Secure login using a PIN verification system.

Check Balance: Real-time retrieval and display of current account balance.

Cash Withdrawal: Logic to process withdrawals while validating sufficient funds.

Cash Deposit: Functionality to input and add funds to the account balance.

Transaction Validation: Error handling to prevent invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers or non-numeric characters).

Exit/Logout: Securely terminates the session.

3. Technical Highlights
This project showcases my ability to write clean, functional code using the following Python concepts:

Control Structures: Extensive use of if-elif-else statements to manage menu navigation and transaction logic.

Loops: Implementation of while loops to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.

Functions: Modular code structure using functions to handle specific tasks (e.g., withdraw(), deposit()), making the code reusable and easy to read.

Data Types & Variables: Management of integers and strings to handle currency and user inputs accurately.

4. How to Run
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sabill/python-wit-atm.git

Navigate to the directory: cd python-wit-atm

Run the application: python atm.py (Replace atm.py with the actual main filename if different)

5. Future Improvements
To further enhance this project, I plan to implement:
Database Integration: Connecting to SQL to store user data persistently.

GUI: Building a graphical user interface using Tkinter or PyQt.

Multi-User Support: Allowing multiple accounts with unique PINs.
